The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Global Drama Verse Guide project, transforming it from a concept into a functional MVP. The work began by establishing a core content display with a modern UI inspired by Netflix and MyDramaList. Key achievements include a robust FastAPI backend with MongoDB, a React frontend utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling, and full CRUD operations for content. The engineer efficiently integrated a secure admin panel, allowing manual content management and a sophisticated bulk import system for Excel/CSV files. Most recently, the focus shifted to user-centric features, successfully implementing a complete user authentication system and foundational user profiles/dashboards, including fixing critical login issues. The current work is precisely aligned with the detailed 7-week roadmap provided by the user, now progressing into enhancing public content discovery.

<product_requirements>
The Global Drama Verse Guide aims to be the most comprehensive, user-friendly, and culturally rich global entertainment guide, inspired by IMDb, MyDramaList, Letterboxd, and streaming UIs like Netflix. The core problem it solves is the fragmentation of existing platforms, offering a unified hub for all global entertainment content with robust social features.

**Implemented Features (MVP & Admin):**
*   **Content Universe:** Comprehensive database for movies, series, dramas, and anime.
*   **UI/UX:** Netflix/iQIYI-inspired dark theme (black/red), responsive design, visual-first browsing, GDVG branding with full name in footer.
*   **Backend:** FastAPI with MongoDB for data storage, JWT-based authentication for both admin and regular users.
*   **Admin System:** Secure login, dashboard with content statistics, manual CRUD operations for content, image uploads (base64).
*   **Bulk Import:** System for uploading Excel/CSV files to bulk create content entries, supporting various content details and formats.
*   **User System:** User registration and login, personal user dashboard, basic profile management (name, bio, avatar upload), and user settings.

**Upcoming/Pending Requirements from New Vision:**
The user has provided a comprehensive new vision, significantly expanding the project scope into a social entertainment platform. Key areas include advanced social networking, personalized tracking, AI-powered discovery, celebrity hubs, and a freemium business model with advertising and subscriptions. The project is following a detailed 7-week roadmap.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for both admin and user authentication.
-   **UI/UX Frameworks:** Tailwind CSS for styling, responsive design principles.
-   **Data Handling:** Pandas library for parsing and processing Excel/CSV files for bulk imports. Base64 encoding for image uploads.
-   **API Design:** RESTful API endpoints prefixed with '/api' for Kubernetes ingress routing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack architecture consisting of a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, interacting with a MongoDB database.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: This is the core of the FastAPI backend, defining all API endpoints, database interactions, and authentication logic.
    *   **Changes**: Initially set up with basic content APIs. Later, modified to include admin authentication (login, JWT handling, default admin user creation), admin content CRUD operations, and a bulk import endpoint () that parses Excel/CSV files. Most recently, user authentication (registration, login, JWT), user profile management, and user settings endpoints were added, distinguishing between 'admin' and 'user' token types.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The main React component that orchestrates the entire frontend, handles global state (e.g., theme, authentication status), routing, and integrates various sub-components.
    *   **Changes**: Initial setup for content display and search. Extensively modified to incorporate Netflix/iQiyi-inspired dark theme and red accents, integrate the new  component, , , , , and  components. It manages the conditional rendering of admin and user interfaces based on authentication status and user type. Recent changes focused on correctly passing state handlers (, , ) to child components (e.g., ) and ensuring smooth authentication flow.
*   ** & **:
    *   **Importance**: Define the global and component-specific styles, heavily leveraging Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Changes**: Updated to implement the requested black/red Netflix/iQiyi color scheme, affecting header, hero section, content cards, interactive elements, genre tags, and modals.
*   **, , **:
    *   **Importance**: Core components for the administrative interface, enabling secure login, content overview, and full CRUD operations.
    *   **Changes**: Created from scratch to provide the admin panel functionality.  was enhanced to include the Bulk Import button and integrate the  component.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Facilitates bulk uploading of content data from Excel/CSV files into the database via the admin panel.
    *   **Changes**: Created, implementing a drag-and-drop file upload UI, detailed instructions for expected file format (required and optional columns, special JSON/comma-separated formats), and a sample template download feature.
*   **, , , **:
    *   **Importance**: New components vital for enabling user registration, login, personalized dashboards, profile management, and viewing statistics.
    *   **Changes**: Created during the Week 1 roadmap phase to transform the platform into a user-driven social entertainment platform.  handles the sign-up/sign-in modals.  serves as the authenticated user's landing page, integrating  (for profile editing/avatar upload) and  (for displaying mock analytics).
*   ** & **:
    *   **Importance**: Manage backend Python and frontend Node.js dependencies respectively.
    *   **Changes**:  updated to include  (for auth) and ,  (for bulk import).  was updated for frontend dependencies.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on **Week 1, Day 3: Public Content Discovery**, as part of the detailed 7-week roadmap.

The most recent significant task involved thoroughly debugging and fixing an issue where the user Sign In and Sign Up buttons were not properly triggering the authentication modal on the frontend, which was giving errors. This debugging process involved:
1.  Testing backend authentication endpoints (, ) manually to confirm they were working correctly (which they were).
2.  Inspecting frontend logs and adding  statements in  and  to trace the state flow and component rendering.
3.  Simplifying the modal trigger for isolated testing, confirming that the buttons and basic modal functionality were working, indicating the issue was likely with the  component's integration or its internal rendering logic.
4.  Ultimately, the issue was identified and fixed, confirming that the authentication system now works flawlessly, triggering the modal, loading the forms, processing submissions, and routing to the user dashboard post-registration/login.

Following the successful fix and verification of the authentication system, the engineer began implementing the **Public Content Discovery** features. This involves:
-   Creating new frontend components:  and .
-   The current action is to update the  to integrate these newly created discovery features, enhancing how users find content.
