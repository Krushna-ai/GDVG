The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Global Drama Verse Guide to an MVP state, including content display, admin CRUD, authentication, watchlist, ratings, social features, AI recommendations, and initial ad integration. The current expert engineer's interaction began by providing a detailed guide to access the newly enhanced admin panel, including screenshots and credentials. Following this, the user requested universal footers on all pages (replacing ad placeholders) and a shift from content detail pop-ups to dedicated pages, inspired by MyDramaList. The engineer successfully implemented the footer across all public, user, and admin pages. Subsequently, the engineer researched MyDramaList and began implementing its page structure in two phases. Phase 1, involving a new  component and basic routing, was completed. Phase 2 focused on the modal-to-navigation transition, but encountered a bug where content was not visible on the homepage. As a result, the engineer pivoted to the user-prioritized task of enhancing the bulk import feature to populate content for testing, which is the current ongoing work.

*   **Backend:** FastAPI with MongoDB, JWT-based authentication for admin and regular users.
*   **Admin System:** Secure login, content statistics, manual CRUD, base64 image uploads, and advanced bulk Excel/CSV import (handling format misses and preventing duplicates with overwrite for global content).
*   **User System:** Registration, login, personal dashboard, profile management (name, bio, avatar), user settings.
*   **Public Content Discovery:** Advanced search, featured sections, content detail modals (being transitioned to dedicated pages).
*   **Personal Tracking:** Watchlist system (Want to Watch, Watching, Completed, Dropped), progress indicators.

*   **Business Model:** Premium subscriptions, ad integration (Google AdSense).

**Recent additions/modifications:**
*   Universal footers across all public, user, and admin pages.
*   Transitioning from content detail modals to dedicated content detail pages, inspired by MyDramaList's structure.
*   Ongoing enhancement of the bulk import feature in the admin panel.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack architecture consisting of a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, interacting with a MongoDB database.



**Key Files and Changes during this trajectory:**

*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Main React component managing routing, global state, and integrating sub-components.
    *   **Changes**: The  component definition was removed and replaced with an import from the new  file. React Router paths were added for  components (e.g., ).  and  helper functions were added to handle navigation for content cards.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: User's personalized dashboard.
    *   **Changes**: The  component was imported and added to all user dashboard views, replacing existing advertisement placeholders. The  logic was updated to use  for direct content page access instead of displaying a modal. The  function was updated to pass navigation correctly.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Admin dashboard component.
    *   **Changes**: The  component was imported and added to the admin dashboard and content management pages to ensure consistent site-wide footers.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: New reusable component for the site-wide footer.
    *   **Changes**: This file was newly created by extracting the  component's logic and structure from . It maintains the dark theme support and existing functionality.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: New component for dedicated content detail pages, inspired by MyDramaList.
    *   **Changes**: This file was newly created to display comprehensive content information, including a MyDramaList-inspired layout with a poster image, tabbed interface (Details, Cast & Crew, Reviews, Photos), and integrated existing features like WatchlistButton, QuickRating, and ReviewSystem.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Component for public content discovery.
    *   **Changes**: The  import was added for React Router integration, and the prop name for the navigation handler was updated to support direct content page links.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Component for bulk content upload via CSV/Excel for administrators.
    *   **Changes**: The component was enhanced to provide better templates and examples for easier admin use. Template generation and download functionality were improved, and a syntax error () was fixed during this process.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully completed the implementation of site-wide footers, replacing advertisement placeholders, and ensuring consistent branding and navigation across all public, user, and admin pages. Following this, the user requested a MyDramaList.com-inspired content detail page structure, moving away from pop-up modals. The AI engineer initiated this by researching MyDramaList and creating a multi-phase plan. Phase 1: Content Detail Pages Structure was completed, involving the creation of a new  component and updating routing to support dedicated URLs. The engineer then proceeded with Phase 2: MyDramaList-Inspired Features to complete the modal-to-navigation transition. However, during testing of Phase 2, a critical issue arose where no content was visible on the homepage (http://localhost:3000) after the changes related to navigation. Due to this content visibility issue, and in line with a prior user request, the engineer pivoted to Phase 3: Enhanced Bulk Import to populate content for testing the new navigation and content detail pages. The current work involves enhancing the  component by improving templates, examples, and download functionality, while also fixing minor syntax issues. The trajectory ends with the engineer planning a simplified, enhanced version of the bulk import for a better user experience.
