The trajectory chronicles an AI engineer's work on a full-stack media guide application. The core challenge throughout the process has been recurring backend regressions, specifically the disappearance of critical API routes in , leading to 404 errors and broken frontend functionality like content display and admin login. The engineer initially focused on user-prioritized tasks: (A) fixing homepage content and navigation, then (D) enhancing the bulk import feature.

Task A was completed successfully, which involved restoring backend routes, seeding a new admin user, and ensuring frontend components fetched data correctly. The engineer then began backend work for Task D, implementing new endpoints for import job previews, progress tracking, and history. This was also successful and validated with backend tests.

However, development was interrupted by a user report of a major regression: the homepage was again showing No content found, despite data being present. The user also requested a new dropdown menu for the site logo. The AI engineer diagnosed the root cause as the same recurring issueâ€”missing public content API routes. The final actions in the trajectory involved successfully restoring these routes in , implementing the requested dropdown in , and verifying the fixes with backend tests, thereby resolving the immediate critical bug.

The Global Drama Verse Guide is an entertainment platform akin to IMDb or MyDramaList, designed to be a central hub for dramas, movies, and anime.

The MVP includes a FastAPI/MongoDB backend, a React frontend, and JWT-based authentication for both users and admins. Key features implemented are user registration/login, watchlists, content discovery sections, and an admin dashboard with CRUD operations.

Recent development focused on stabilizing the application and adding features based on a user-defined priority list. This included implementing site-wide footers, transitioning to dedicated content detail pages, and significantly enhancing the bulk import tool to support flexible formats, URL-based imports, and a preview function.

A critical recurring problem has been the intermittent loss of backend API routes, causing major regressions like the homepage failing to display content. The latest work cycle successfully fixed this regression, restored content visibility, and added a Netflix-style dropdown menu to the main navigation logo as requested by the user. The next phase is to complete the UI for the enhanced bulk import feature.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture:** React.js frontend, FastAPI (Python) backend, and MongoDB database.
- **API & Routing:** RESTful API design where all backend routes must be prefixed with  for Kubernetes ingress compatibility. Frontend routing is managed by .
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to secure admin and user endpoints.
- **Data Handling:** The  library is used on the backend for processing bulk imports from CSV/Excel files. Pydantic models are used for data validation and serialization.
</-/key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monolithic repository structure with separate directories for the frontend and backend services.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the single most critical file, containing the entire FastAPI application, all API routes, database models, and business logic.
  - **Changes:** This file has been edited extensively. Key changes include:
    - Addition and repeated restoration of core API routes (, , , etc.) to fix 404 errors.
    - Implementation of new endpoints for advanced bulk importing, including previews (), job tracking (), and history.
    - Seeding of a default admin user and a user-specified admin account on application startup.
    - Addition of basic diagnostic endpoints.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main entry point for the React application, responsible for defining routes and managing global layout components like navigation and footers.
  - **Changes:**
    - React Router paths were added to support dedicated content detail pages ().
    - The top navigation bar was modified, and a new dropdown menu was added to the GDVG logo.
    - Logic was updated to fix issues related to user authentication modals.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The frontend component for the admin's bulk content import feature.
  - **Changes:** The backend logic for this feature has been completely overhauled, but the frontend component has not yet been updated to use the new endpoints for progress bars and import history. This is a key pending task.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main dashboard for administrators after they log in.
  - **Changes:** A bug related to the logout function () was fixed by implementing a  function that ensures the admin token is removed and the user is redirected correctly, even if callbacks are missing.

- ****
  - **Importance:** A crucial file for tracking testing plans, user problem statements, and communication logs with automated testing agents.
  - **Changes:** This file was continuously updated by the AI engineer and testing agents to log the results of backend and frontend test runs, ensuring a clear record of what has been validated.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Priority D:** Implement the frontend UI for the bulk import feature. This includes wiring up the  component to the new backend endpoints for previewing data, polling for import progress, and displaying a history of past import jobs.
- **Implement Priority B:** Enhance the  page with more MyDramaList-inspired features, such as cast/crew sections and photo galleries.
- **Implement Priority C:** Create an admin diagnostics page in the frontend to surface the data from the new backend diagnostic endpoints.
- Add Google Authentication and an OTP system for password changes.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical regression reported by the user. The application's homepage was displaying a No content found message, even though content was visible in the admin dashboard. This issue was caused by the recurring problem of essential public-facing API routes being missing from the  file.

The engineer's most recent actions were:
1.  **Diagnosed the Issue:** Identified that the  and other related public endpoints were returning 404 Not Found errors, confirming the root cause was in the backend.
2.  **Implemented a Fix:** Edited  to restore all the necessary API routes for fetching public content, featured sections, genres, and countries.
3.  **Implemented a New Feature:** Simultaneously addressed a new user request by modifying  to add a dropdown menu to the GDVG logo in the top navigation bar.
4.  **Verified the Fix:** Ran a comprehensive suite of backend tests using the  agent, which confirmed that all restored routes, including , were now responding with a 200 OK status.

The current state is that the critical bug is resolved, the new feature is implemented, and the backend has been verified as stable. The application is now ready for the next phase of development.

<optional_next_step>
Proceed with the frontend implementation for Priority D: enhance the  component to use the new backend endpoints for showing import progress and history. This aligns with the previously agreed-upon development plan.
